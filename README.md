# Cellular-Automata-Evacuation
A basic model for simulating people's evacuation of a room using cellular automata

## Requirements:
* Lua 5.3

## Instructions:
* Just execute the command 'lua evac.lua'

## Some important info:
* There are some hard coded variables that defines things like size of the room and how many people are in the room when the simulation starts.
* People and door starting position are randomly generated with the random seed being based on systems clock.
* Variable 'universe_size' defines the size of the room being universe_size x universe-size and variable N defines how many people are on the room.
